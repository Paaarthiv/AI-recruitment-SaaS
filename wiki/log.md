## [2026-05-22 17:25] update | AI Responsibility Standardization

Standardized the production AI architecture around `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for embeddings, deterministic hybrid scoring for ranking, and Qwen2.5-Coder:7B via Ollama as the primary LLM for summaries, explanations, recruiter insights, resume analysis, and interview generation. Added the central AI responsibility split, marked ranking/prompt experiments as experimental rather than production behavior, and redacted a plaintext API key note into a secret-management placeholder.

## [2026-05-29 23:02] update | Lumina Nexus UI UX Foundation

Created the complete Lumina Nexus UI/UX foundation for the recruiter and candidate portals, including design tokens, typography, spacing, component library, navigation architecture, and requested wireframe/layout sections. Added concept pages for the Lumina Nexus design direction and referenced product features, then updated the wiki index.

## [2026-05-30 01:09] update | Lumina Nexus — Clarification as Design Theme

Corrected a misclassification: **Lumina Nexus is a color/design theme, not the product name.** The product is currently using **RecruitAI** as a placeholder name in the UI until an official product name is decided.

Changes made:
- Updated `wiki/concepts/Lumina Nexus.md` — added clarification notice, reframed definition as a design/color system, not a product brand.
- Updated `wiki/overview.md` — corrected the Product Experience section to distinguish Lumina Nexus (theme) from RecruitAI (product name placeholder).
- Updated all frontend files (`app/layout.tsx`, `app/(public)/layout.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/login/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/register/page.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`) — replaced "Lumina Nexus" brand references with "RecruitAI".

## [2026-06-06 02:30] update | Activated Real Semantic Embeddings

Switched the embedding pipeline from the `local_hashing` placeholder to real semantic embeddings using `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` via the `sentence_transformers` provider (default in `settings/base.py`). The placeholder hashed tokens into a sparse vector, so the 0.45-weighted `semantic_score` was effectively keyword overlap; it now captures conceptual meaning (e.g. "cloud infrastructure" ≈ "AWS"). Verified end-to-end: 384-dim normalized vectors, relevant candidate cosine 0.78 vs irrelevant 0.50. Re-embedded existing data (1 job, 4 parsed resumes) and re-scored applications (final scores moved ~61-68% -> 85-88%). All 45 backend tests pass.

**Notes:** `ollama` provider remains available via `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama` for cloud embeddings. Backend runtime uses `.venv-codex` (the `.venv` dir is stale, created on another machine). `requirements.txt` now includes `sentence-transformers>=3.0.0` (pulls torch).

## [2026-06-06 03:30] fix | Resume Parsing: Primary LLM + Null-Tolerant Validation

Fixed why resume parsing never used the primary LLM and kept falling back to the secondary model / deterministic heuristic. Two independent root causes:

1. **Primary model was broken on the endpoint.** `gpt-oss:20b` on Ollama Cloud (`https://ollama.com`) returns HTTP 200 with token counts but an **empty** `response`/`thinking` field for every config (generate/chat, format=json or not, think true/false) — its harmony-channel output is dropped server-side. (`gpt-oss:120b` works; `gpt-oss:20b` does not.) Switched the primary to **`qwen3-coder:480b`** (fastest + reliable JSON in testing, ~6s end-to-end), fallback chain `gemma3:12b,gemma3:4b`.
2. **Validation discarded good parses.** Non-optional `str` fields (e.g. `Language.proficiency`, `Experience.role`, `Education.institution`) raised `ValidationError` when the LLM emitted `null` for a sub-field the resume omits. A single null anywhere forced the whole parse to fall through. Added a base-model `mode=before` validator that coerces `null` → field default for required strings. This bug would have sabotaged *any* model.

Also fixed two accuracy quirks surfaced during verification: duplicate education rows (heuristic partial entry now merges into the LLM entry by year) and an over-restrictive language whitelist (added Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, and many world/Indian languages).

Verified end-to-end (DOCX → extract → parse) using the live `qwen3-coder:480b`: high confidence, zero validation errors, complete extraction. Added 2 regression tests; full backend suite 58 passed.

**Files touched:** `backend/apps/candidates/resume_parser.py`, `backend/apps/candidates/tests/test_resume_parser.py`, `backend/config/settings/base.py`, `backend/.env`, `backend/.env.example`

## [2026-06-06 21:30] analysis | Sprint 8 Candidate Ranking — Implementation Review

Researched the vault (Sprint 8 plan, Sprint 7, AI Responsibilities, Hybrid Ranking System, Semantic Matching, Candidate API) against the actual codebase and filed a new analysis. **Key finding: Sprint 8 (Candidate Ranking Engine) is functionally delivered** — the hybrid 45/30/25 formula, alias-aware skill matching, real timeline-based experience scoring, the `GET /jobs/{id}/ranked-candidates/` endpoint (full breakdown + matched/missing skills), and the recruiter-facing breakdown UI (job + application pages) all exist and pass tests. The earlier "matched/missing skills die before the frontend" gap is resolved.

Recommended continuation (does not rebuild what exists, preserves "Math decides. AI explains."): (1) reconcile docs incl. `candidate-api.md` to the live contract; (2) harden the scoring path — Celery `batch_score_applications` + serve cached `Application` scores, recompute only when stale/forced, add `min_score`/`skills_met` filters; (3) surface `missing_skills` in the UI; (4) keep the LLM explanation layer deferred to Phase 4 with a nullable seam; (5) keep scores on `Application` (defer a dedicated `CandidateScore` history table). Recommend closing Sprint 8 and proceeding to Sprint 9 (Hiring Pipeline).

## [2026-06-06 22:15] feature | Sprint 8 Close-Out — Candidate Ranking Hardening

Implemented the approved Sprint 8 hardening (deterministic only; LLM explanation layer remains deferred to Phase 4):

- **Read-only ranked GET.** Split `ranking.py` `score_application` into `build_candidate_score` (pure compute, no DB write) + `persist_application_scores`; `rank_candidates_for_job` is now read-only by default. Viewing rankings no longer mutates `Application` rows (previously every GET recomputed and wrote all four score fields).
- **Event-driven batch scoring.** New Celery task `batch_score_applications(job_id)`; enqueued on job create/update (`jobs/views.py: enqueue_batch_score`) after embedding. Parse-time scoring unchanged.
- **Ranked filters.** `RankedCandidatesView` now supports `min_score` and `skills_met` query params; applied filters echoed in the response.
- **UI completes the "why".** Job ranked list now renders each candidate's `missing_skills` as chips (data already in the API).

Verification: 62 backend tests pass (+4 new: read-only GET, batch persistence, min_score + skills_met filters); ruff clean; frontend type-check, lint, and production build pass. `raw/` left immutable per vault convention.

**Files touched:** `backend/apps/ai_engine/ranking.py`, `backend/apps/ai_engine/tasks.py`, `backend/apps/jobs/views.py`, `backend/apps/ai_engine/tests.py`, `frontend/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`

## [2026-06-06 23:10] feature | Sprint 9 Phase 9A — Drag-and-Drop Pipeline

Implemented Phase 9A of Sprint 9 (Hiring Pipeline). Decision (with user): **phased** — ship drag-and-drop on the existing fixed 8-status enum now (no data migration); defer configurable **per-organization** stages to Phase 9B.

Research showed most of the pipeline already existed: the Kanban board, the `updateApplicationStatus()` client fn, the move endpoint (`PATCH /applications/{id}/status/` → records `ApplicationHistory` via `transition_status`), and the status-history timeline UI on the application detail page. The only gap was the drag interaction.

Changes (frontend only — no backend changes needed): added `@dnd-kit/core`; rebuilt `dashboard/pipeline/page.tsx` with `DndContext` (PointerSensor with an 8px activation distance so a plain click still navigates; KeyboardSensor for a11y), droppable columns, draggable cards, and an **optimistic** move that calls the existing status endpoint and rolls back on error. Column counts update live.

Verification: frontend type-check, lint, and production build pass; backend candidates tests (status update + history) green. Phase 9B (per-org `PipelineStage` model + migration + config panel) documented as the next chunk; WebSockets, auto-actions, interview feedback, and time-in-stage remain out of scope.

**Files touched:** `frontend/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/pipeline/page.tsx`, `frontend/package.json`

## [2026-06-07 22:30] feature | Sprint 9 Complete — Hiring Pipeline (9A + 9B Verified)

Closed out Sprint 9. Phase 9A (drag-and-drop Kanban, Claude session) shipped earlier; Phase 9B (configurable per-job stages) was implemented end-to-end by a parallel Codex/Antigravity session and has now been **verified, smoked, and documented** here.

9B delivers: `PipelineStage` (per-job, status-mapped, ordered, colored, terminal flag, soft-delete) with lazy + migration seeding of the default 8 stages; `PipelineStageHistory` dual audit alongside `ApplicationHistory`; `Application.current_stage` FK kept in sync atomically by `move_application_to_stage()`; APIs for board/stage CRUD/reorder/move under `/api/v1/pipeline/`; and a stage-aware board UI with a full "Job stages" management panel (rename, status mapping, recolor, terminal, add, remove, reorder). Stage-UUID droppable keys give exact-stage drag targeting; the all-jobs board keeps status-keyed fallback.

Decision recorded: stages are **per-job** (matches the sprint task list; more flexible than the per-org schema doc) with canonical status mapping preserving candidate portal/analytics/ranking behavior.

Verification: migrations clean; full backend suite **66 passed** (4 new pipeline tests); frontend type-check/lint/build pass; real-data smoke confirmed seeding, board counts, atomic move with dual history, and revert. Deferred: WebSockets, optimistic locking, auto_actions execution, interview feedback, funnel analytics.

## [2026-06-10 21:41] planning | Sprint 10 Candidate Dashboard

Verified Sprint 8 and Sprint 9 against the current codebase and validation suite, then filed the Sprint 10 candidate dashboard implementation plan. Sprint 10 should build a recruiter-facing candidate profile dashboard around existing parsed resume data, deterministic scores, pipeline stages, activity history, and candidate notes, with AI summary generation planned as cached recruiter assistance rather than ranking logic.

**Pages touched:** [[Sprint 10 Candidate Dashboard Plan]], [[index|Wiki Index]], [[overview|Overview]], [[log|Activity Log]]

---

## [2026-06-10 22:16] feature | Sprint 10 Core Candidate Dashboard

Implemented the core Sprint 10 candidate dashboard slice. Backend now has `CandidateNote`, tenant-scoped candidate profile aggregation, candidate notes endpoints, and tests for profile shape, organization isolation, missing parsed resumes, multiple applications, and notes lifecycle. Frontend now has `/dashboard/candidates`, `/dashboard/candidates/[id]`, profile tabs for overview/resume/scores/activity/notes, and links from existing recruiter application views.

Validation: migrations applied locally; backend system check, Ruff, focused candidate tests, full backend tests, frontend type-check, frontend lint, and production build pass. Deferred: AI summary generation, candidate comparison, real-time updates, interview scheduling, photo upload, and analytics.

---

## [2026-06-11 00:20] feature | Sprint 11 Semantic Search

Implemented Sprint 11 core semantic search. Backend now exposes recruiter-scoped `/api/v1/search/`, `/api/v1/search/candidates/`, and `/api/v1/search/jobs/` endpoints using existing embeddings plus deterministic hybrid relevance (semantic similarity + keyword match), filters, result limits, and short cache TTLs. Frontend now has `/dashboard/search` with query input, search type tabs, filters, score cards, and links into candidate profiles and job details.

Validation: backend Ruff passes, Django system check passes, AI engine tests pass, candidate portal regression tests pass, frontend type-check passes, frontend lint passes, and frontend production build passes. Also fixed the existing SQLite test blocker by making historical pgvector HNSW index migrations Postgres-only at database execution time while preserving migration state.

---

## [2026-06-11 21:15] planning | Sprint 11 Close-Out and Sprint 12 Plan

Audited the Sprint 11 semantic search implementation after the duplicate-key and keyword-matching fixes. Confirmed the core Sprint 11 scope is complete: recruiter-scoped search APIs, candidate/job/all search modes, semantic + keyword hybrid relevance, filters, cached responses, dashboard search UI, duplicate-safe candidate results, and normalized keyword matching. Deferred Sprint 11 enhancements remain BM25/Postgres full-text ranking, saved searches, analytics, Redis-backed distributed cache, typeahead, highlighting, salary range, and location-radius facets.

Filed the Sprint 12 AI Interview Assistance plan. Sprint 12 should add generated interview question sets, category/rationale/evaluation criteria, question notes, and a question-bank fallback while preserving the rule that AI assistance must not change score, rank, status, or hiring recommendation.

Validation: backend Ruff passes, Django system check passes, migration drift check passes, AI engine tests pass, candidate portal regression tests pass, frontend type-check passes, frontend lint passes, production build passes, backend health returns 200, and unauthenticated browser smoke redirects `/dashboard/search` to login without console errors.

---

## [2026-06-11 22:40] feature | Sprint 12 Core AI Interview Assistance

Implemented Sprint 12 core. Backend now has an `interviews` app with application-scoped question sets, questions, per-question notes, question-bank items, recruiter-scoped APIs, LLM generation with schema validation, and question-bank fallback when generation fails. Frontend now adds an Interview Prep panel to recruiter application detail with generate/regenerate, grouped question cards, rationale, evaluation criteria, model/fallback indicator, and recruiter notes.

The implementation preserves the product rule that interview assistance must not alter application score, rank, status, pipeline stage, or hiring recommendation.

Validation: backend Ruff passes, Django system check passes, migration drift check passes, new interview tests pass, focused AI/candidate/interview regression tests pass, frontend type-check passes, frontend lint passes, production build passes, local Postgres migration applied, backend health returns 200, and the interview API requires authentication.

Deferred: pin/reorder UI, manual question editing UI, question bank picker modal, print/export view, scheduling integrations, answer evaluation, recommendations, analytics, and a broader bias-evaluation fixture suite.

## [2026-06-11 19:20] feature | Sprint 13A — Notifications (in-app + email)

Verified Sprints 10–12 (candidate dashboard, semantic search, interview AI) all working — 83 backend tests, frontend builds, live smoke of search + interview generation passed — then implemented Sprint 13 Phase 13A.

Phased per decision: 13A now (in-app + email + per-event preferences, bell updated by polling — no new infra); 13B later (Django Channels/WebSocket real-time, which also retro-enables the Sprint 9 live board). Email via Django SMTP (console in dev, env-configured SMTP in prod — no provider SDK).

New `apps.notifications`: `Notification` + `NotificationPreference` models; `notify()` service (preference-aware, self-actor skipped) + `send_notification_email` task; REST endpoints (list/unread-count/read/mark-all-read/preferences). Triggers wired into status-update, pipeline move, and public apply (notify the job owner). Frontend: `NotificationBell` in the dashboard top bar (badge + dropdown + polling) and a preferences toggle matrix page.

Verification: migration applied; full backend suite green incl. 8 new notification tests; frontend type-check/lint/build pass; live smoke confirmed in-app row + console email + self-actor skip + mark-all-read.

**Files touched:** new `backend/apps/notifications/*`; `backend/config/settings/base.py`, `backend/config/urls.py`; triggers in `apps/candidates/views.py`, `apps/jobs/views.py`, `apps/pipeline/views.py`; `frontend/components/NotificationBell.tsx`, `frontend/lib/notifications.ts`, `frontend/types/notifications.ts`, `frontend/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`, `frontend/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/settings/notifications/page.tsx`
