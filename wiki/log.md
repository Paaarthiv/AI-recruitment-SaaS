## [2026-05-30 16:05] update | Sprint 3 Jobs and Applications Foundation Plan

Filed the Sprint 3 scope as a wiki analysis page, marked Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Sprint 2.1 complete in the roadmap status, and set Jobs, Applications, and candidate foundation as the next product sprint while keeping AI/resume/pipeline features out of scope.

## [2026-05-30 15:41] update | Sprint 2.1 Auth Hardening Implementation

Implemented the Sprint 2.1 auth hardening scope: confirm-password registration, scoped auth throttling, silent refresh retry behavior, session-expiration handling, and focused backend auth tests. Verified backend lint, Django checks, migrations, tests, frontend lint/type-check, and frontend production dependency audit.

## [2026-05-30 15:29] update | Sprint 2.1 Auth Hardening Plan

Filed the recommended Sprint 2.1 scope as a wiki analysis page, clarifying that candidate authentication is intentionally out of scope for Sprint 2.1 and that the next work should harden recruiter/admin authentication before Sprint 3.

## [2026-05-30 15:13] update | Sprint 2 Auth and Tenancy Cleanup

## [2026-05-30 00:40] update | Sprint 1 Foundation Implementation

Implemented the Sprint 1 project foundation as a monorepo scaffold while keeping the human-managed `raw/` sprint plan immutable. Added backend, frontend, Docker Compose, CI, pre-commit, Supabase local config, environment example, README setup docs, and a wiki implementation record.

## [2026-05-29 21:09] update | MCP Architecture and Development Tools

Filed the MCP architecture update in the wiki layer, documenting core MCP servers, later-stage MCP servers, newly introduced development tools, Postman's API-testing role, and lifecycle labels for production, experimental, and deprecated formulas. Preserved existing raw architecture and experiment notes, then normalized stale wiki links discovered during the vault check.

## [2026-05-23 01:31] query | Candidate and Recruiter User Perspectives

Synthesized how the AI Recruitment SaaS works from candidate and recruiter perspectives, using the wiki overview plus product feature/API docs for the recruiter workflow. Noted that the current product documentation is recruiter-first and does not yet define a full candidate portal experience.

## [2026-05-22 16:40] lint | Vault Integrity Cleanup

Resolved the vault health issues found during the audit: added missing entity and decision pages, restored the missing source file reference, normalized wikilinks and API versioning, reconciled embedding/scoring architecture, clarified Supabase auth/storage boundaries, added analytics/project/API support docs, and updated the index. Final consistency pass also aligned job-specific workflows around `candidate_applications` / `application_id` and made the frontend `/api/v1` base path explicit.

## [2026-05-22 17:25] update | AI Responsibility Standardization

Standardized the production AI architecture around `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for embeddings, deterministic hybrid scoring for ranking, and Qwen2.5-Coder:7B via Ollama as the primary LLM for summaries, explanations, recruiter insights, resume analysis, and interview generation. Added the central AI responsibility split, marked ranking/prompt experiments as experimental rather than production behavior, and redacted a plaintext API key note into a secret-management placeholder.

**Pages touched:** `raw/architecture/ai-responsibilities.md`, `raw/architecture/ai-pipeline.md`, `raw/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `raw/architecture/mcp-context.md`, `raw/ai-prompts/candidate-scoring.md`, `raw/experiments/ranking-formula-tests.md`, `raw/experiments/prompt-experiments.md`

## [2026-05-29 23:02] update | Lumina Nexus UI UX Foundation

Created the complete Lumina Nexus UI/UX foundation for the recruiter and candidate portals, including design tokens, typography, spacing, component library, navigation architecture, and requested wireframe/layout sections. Added concept pages for the Lumina Nexus design direction and referenced product features, then updated the wiki index.

## [2026-05-30 01:09] update | Lumina Nexus — Clarification as Design Theme

Corrected a misclassification: **Lumina Nexus is a color/design theme, not the product name.** The product is currently using **RecruitAI** as a placeholder name in the UI until an official product name is decided.

Changes made:
- Updated `wiki/concepts/Lumina Nexus.md` — added clarification notice, reframed definition as a design/color system, not a product brand.
- Updated `wiki/overview.md` — corrected the Product Experience section to distinguish Lumina Nexus (theme) from RecruitAI (product name placeholder).
- Updated all frontend files (`app/layout.tsx`, `app/(public)/layout.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/login/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/register/page.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`) — replaced "Lumina Nexus" brand references with "RecruitAI".
